I've always loved how word clouds look, so I wrote up a MATLAB implementation for images. Like the Wordle algorithm [described here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/342687/algorithm-to-implement-a-word-cloud-like-wordle), the code spirals out from a point on a canvas until it finds a point to place the image where no intersection occurs. Code and a few sample images are on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/ojwalch/picture-clouds).

A few more sample outputs are below; image themes include: Audrey Hepburn, Eartha Kitt, Agatha Christie, Virginia Woolf, The Canterbury Tales, and [my beloved Nancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Bushmiller).
