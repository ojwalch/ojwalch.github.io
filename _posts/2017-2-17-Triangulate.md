I wrote a quick and low-key Matlab script a while ago to triangulate images through the magic of Delaunay Triangulation and corner detection. The code is available [here](https://github.com/ojwalch/triangulate-svg), and running it both plots the result in Matlab and saves it to an SVG file. Check out a few demos below!
