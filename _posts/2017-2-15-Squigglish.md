<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/squigglish!/id1200924640?mt=8">Squigglish!</a> is an iOS drawing app that makes the lines you draw wiggle. You can draw on a solid color canvas or on photos, and your creations can be exported to movies or GIFs. Like other projects of mine with <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~majaco/">Matt</a>, itâ€™s powered by the magic of Fourier series. You can download the app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/squigglish!/id1200924640?mt=8">here</a>, and look below for some sample outputs. I'll be updating this gallery with some of my favorite Squigglish creations, and anyone who's interested should feel encouraged to submit their faves!
