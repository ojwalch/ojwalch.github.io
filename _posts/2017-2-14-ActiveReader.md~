I have a terrible time learning and retaining content from reading articles or textbooks, so I wrote a little bit of code to take a block of text and turn it into a multiple choice quiz by removing one word from every sentence. It's called [ActiveReader](http://www.oliviawalch.com/active-reader), and the code behind it is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ojwalch/active-reader). 

See the screenshot below for a shot of it in action, or try it yourself [here](http://www.oliviawalch.com/active-reader).
